# MLFlow
MLflow is an open-source platform designed to manage the machine learning (ML) lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment. It provides tools to track experiments, package models, and deploy them in various environments.

### **Key Components of MLflow**
1. **MLflow Tracking** ‚Äì Logs and tracks ML experiments, including parameters, metrics, and artifacts.
2. **MLflow Projects** ‚Äì Defines reusable and reproducible ML code workflows.
3. **MLflow Models** ‚Äì Standard format to package ML models for deployment.
4. **MLflow Registry** ‚Äì Centralized model store for versioning and lifecycle management.

### **Installation**
```bash
pip install mlflow
```

### **Basic Example**
```python
import mlflow

mlflow.start_run()
mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.5)
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", 0.85)
mlflow.end_run()
```

To view the **MLflow UI**, follow these steps:

### **1. Start the MLflow Tracking Server**
First, navigate to your working directory and run:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

By default, this starts the UI at:  
üìç **http://127.0.0.1:5000**

### **2. Specify a Different Port (Optional)**
If port `5000` is in use, you can specify a different port:

```bash
mlflow ui --port 8080
```
Now, access the UI at: **http://127.0.0.1:8080**

### **3. Run MLflow on a Remote Server (Optional)**
If you're using a remote server, allow external access:

```bash
mlflow ui --host 0.0.0.0
```
Then, access it via:  
`http://<server-ip>:5000`
